Add some jazz & pizazz to your project with a color touchscreen LCD. This TFT display is big (2.8" diagonal) bright (4 white-LED backlight) and colorful! 240x320 pixels with individual RGB pixel control, this has way more resolution than a black and white 128x64 display. As a bonus, this display has a resistive touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect finger presses anywhere on the screen.

The ILI9325 screen has been discontinued, but the 2.8" ILI341 touchscreen breakout is nearly identical, having both an 8-bit and a SPI interface mode as well as a MicroSD card socket, all in the same form factor!
